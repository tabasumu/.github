## Who :shrug:
` We Believe In Sharing `

Just a bunch of random devs who would like to share what they've learnt and help those who'd like to learn.
## What :facepalm:
` Coffee with Impresssive Crafters`

It takes many hands to craft the best software that's why we are committed to innovate and create new experiences together and enjoy the process as we go.

## How :ok_person:
`crawl | walk | jog | run `

We believe in the process... Haha psych, we don't know!
We're just making libraries and apps as we go to help the next developer.

### Being A Villager :firefighter:
It's an open free society, contribute and you'll see yourself becoming a villager, heck you'd even become a village elder or chief! Just be wary of the hunters and gatherers

## Village Stuff :wink: :blush: :smirk: :hugs:
Let's just say there's a lot of stuff going on in our tribe, but you can find some updates at :drum: :drum: :drum:

Go to twitter and find some funny stuff...
